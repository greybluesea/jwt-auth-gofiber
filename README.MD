## JWT auth on GoFiber api (GORM + Postgres) - inspired by TDot Code


please note:
Currently, the "github.com/gofiber/contrib/jwt" library plus "github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5" library only works with http 1.1.

It doesn't work with Postman, or with our usual browsers ... (same with TDot Code's implementation)
